# Product Overview

Phyllotaxis Planner is an organic thought organization tool that applies the mathematical principles of phyllotaxis (leaf arrangement patterns in plants) to create beautiful, natural layouts for ideas and tasks.

## Core Concept

The application uses the golden angle (137.5Â°) to automatically arrange user-input ideas in a spiral pattern, mimicking how plants optimize leaf placement for maximum sunlight exposure. This creates an intuitive, visually appealing alternative to traditional mind mapping tools.

## Key Features

- **Natural Positioning**: Ideas are automatically arranged using phyllotaxis algorithms
- **Organic Growth**: New ideas appear with smooth animations that feel alive
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across all devices
- **High Performance**: Optimized for handling large numbers of ideas
- **Accessibility**: Built with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in mind

## Target Users

- Knowledge workers organizing complex thoughts
- Students creating visual study materials  
- Designers exploring creative concepts
- Anyone seeking a more natural approach to idea organization

## Technical Philosophy

The application emphasizes:
- Mathematical beauty through natural patterns
- Performance through efficient algorithms
- Maintainability through clean architecture
- User experience through thoughtful design
